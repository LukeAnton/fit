# Fit

## Final Project GA - Fit is a location based peer to peer fitness application that makes finding the right personal trainer easy.

#### Users seeking a Trainer will be able to create a profile and find nearby Trainers based off their current location.

#### Users can make payment to a Trainer on request.

#### Trainers will be able to create a specialised profile listing skills and hourly rate.

#### A Trainer can receive a request and payment for service by a Seeking User

## Cool Stuff

#### Express Validator allows you to set up really nice checks, works amazing with express and custom error messages that you can return in various types like an array

#### Postman really helped with a visual with development allowing all requests to be saved in folders and related to the request -----show errors and postman getup-----

#### A pleasent suprise was that the Navigator.geolocation interface is built into all browsers and works on mobile too. the Navigator.geolocation function returns an object containing location information of the device.

#### Redux steps -- Create action types.js, fire the action, in reducer define the action logic

###Hooks -------- useState replaces this.state = {state} and this.setState{blah} with

        --data--    --function--

const [stateData, setFunction] = useState({
data0: '',
data1: '',
data3: '',
});

---deconstruction---
const [data0, data1, data2] = stateData;

----setting the state----
setTrainers(result.data);

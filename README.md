### Users can make payment to a Trainer on request.

### Trainers will be able to create a specialised profile listing skills and hourly rate.

### A Trainer can receive a request and payment for service by a Seeking User

## Cool Stuff

#### Express Validator allows you to set up really nice checks, works amazing with express and custom error messages that you can return in various types like an array

#### Postman really helped with a visual with development allowing all requests to be saved in folders and related to the request -----show errors and postman getup-----

#### Another thing i found pretty interesting was using sub-documents in MongoDB allowing you to have a schema inside a schema. In my opinion i think it helps with neatness. -- it is also not needed because the whole point of mongoDB is to veer away from schemas because they are very rigid with the data structure the provide where as collections are a flexible alternative to a schema allowing you to nest data inside the collection and use aggregate methods to retrieve it.

#### A pleasent suprise was that the Navigator.geolocation interface is built into all browsers and works on mobile too. the Navigator.geolocation function returns an object containing location information of the device.
